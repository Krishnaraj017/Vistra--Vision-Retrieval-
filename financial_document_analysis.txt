The text provides a market performance report for January 2025, highlighting the complex global macro environment. The report notes that the US growth and inflation dynamics may lead to stagflation, and tariff news flow is causing uncertainty and inflation resilience. The report also mentions that the US might experience a negative growth surprise, and Trump's policies may lead to a negative global growth impulse. 

The report highlights that emerging markets, including India, are witnessing strong capital outflows, but the depreciating dollar index is a positive sign. Europe and China's growth rates remain subdued, but Europe might benefit from the current environment. Geopolitical tensions are increasing, and supply chains and global trade are vulnerable. 

The report concludes that India remains a differentiated market with structural growth and earnings potential, despite the current cyclical slowdown.

Indian macroeconomic conditions remain strong, with a GDP growth rate of 5.4% and 6.2% for 2Q/3QFY25, although consensus has downgraded FY25 GDP growth to 6.5%. Current Account Deficit is expected to be 1-1.5% for FY25E/FY26E. Domestic equity market is focused on earnings, with structural earning growth at >15% CAGR for FY20-24, although FY25E has moderated to mid-high single digit. Cyclical slowdown is driven by reduced government spending, above-average monsoon, and stringent liquidity actions by RBI. Financials, Pharma, industrials, Telecom, Hospital, Hotels, Aviation, and Real Estate are witnessing a healthy earnings cycle, while FMCG, Commodities, and IT face headwinds. Indian equity market trades at 19xFY26/17xFY27 consensus Nifty earnings, in an attractive valuation zone from a medium-term perspective. Large caps seem attractive, while mid-caps and small caps trade at a 10-15% premium to their historical valuations. FY26/27 is expected to be a stock pickers market. The Indian economy is in a structural upcycle, driven by corporate and bank balance sheets, consumer spending, government investments, and global supply chain re-alignments.
