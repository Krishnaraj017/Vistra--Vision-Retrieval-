The table calculates the Weighted Average Bed Temperature (WABT) of a reactor with 4 beds, which correlates to catalyst activity and is critical for monitoring catalyst deactivation rates. WABT is calculated by multiplying the weight fraction of each bed by its Average Bed Temperature (ABT) and summing the results.
The image presents three distinct text boxes, each describing a different temperature-related parameter. The boxes are arranged horizontally.

The first box, outlined with a blue dotted line at the top and a solid blue line at the bottom, is titled "WABT - Weighted Average Bed Temperature." Below the title are three bullet points:
* "Correlates to catalyst activity"
* "Critical parameter used for monitoring catalyst deactivation rates"
* "Calculation changes each time the reactors are loaded with catalyst"

The second box, outlined with a green dotted line at the top and a solid green line at the bottom, is titled "Delta T, temperature rise, axial bed rise." It contains two bullet points:
* "Average bed outlet temperature – average bed inlet temperature"
* "Indication of heat of reaction"

The third box, outlined with a blue dotted line at the top and a solid blue line at the bottom, is titled "Radial temperature spread, radial DT." It includes two bullet points:
* "Maximum – Minimum among temperature readings at the same level in the reactor"
* "Used as indication of flow distribution"
