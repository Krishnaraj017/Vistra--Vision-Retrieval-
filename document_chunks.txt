As of February 28, 2025, India's economic indicators are as follows: 

Inflation rate decreased to 4.31% in January 2025 from 5.22% in December 2024, primarily due to a slowdown in food and beverage inflation. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) decreased to 2.31% in January 2025 from 2.37% in December 2024. 

Index of Industrial Production (IIP) slowed down to a 3-month low of 3.2% in December 2024 from 5% in November 2024. The manufacturing sector grew by 3%, while the mining and electricity sectors recorded growth rates of 2.6% and 6.2%, respectively. 

The S&P Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slid to a 14-month low of 56.3 in February 2025 from 57.7 in January 2025, driven by softer new orders and production growth. PMI Services increased to 59 in February 2025 from 56.5 in January 2025, boosted by improving domestic and international demand. 

Brent crude oil decreased to US$ 73.18 on February 25, 2025, from US$ 76.76 on January 25, 2025, due to worries about global economic growth and uncertainty about the outlook for oil demand. The Rupee closed the month on 87.5125 against the US Dollar as of February 25, 2025.
Indian equity markets declined in the month, with Nifty 50 and S&P BSE Sensex falling by 5.89% and 5.55%, respectively, due to the rupee's record fall against the US dollar, broad-based sell-off across sectors, and concerns over weak corporate earnings in Q3 FY'25. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in Indian equities, worth ₹-35,694.26 crore. Despite a 9.1% year-on-year increase in Gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in February 2025, reaching ₹1.84 trillion, market sentiments were affected by concerns over potential US tariffs and delayed interest rate reduction. The Dow Jones decreased by 1.58% from the previous month. The yield on the 10-Year benchmark paper in India remained range-bound, closing at 6.729% on February 25, 2025, while the US 10-year G-Sec closed lower at 4.2082% on February 25, 2025, compared to 4.5387% on January 25, 2025.
India's GDP grew 6.2% in Q3 FY25, up from 5.4% in Q2 FY25. The Manufacturing sector's growth decreased to 3.5% in Q3 FY25 from 14.0% in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. In contrast, the Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry & Fishing sector's growth increased to 5.6% in Q3 FY25 from 1.5% in Q3 FY24. The real GDP growth for FY25 is expected to be 6.5%, driven by the agri sector's growth, government spending, capex, and improved consumption demand. The recovery in urban consumption and anticipated rate cuts by RBI are also positive for growth.
Here is a summary of the equity market review:

In February 2025, the Nifty 50 index dropped 5.89% due to the rupee's record fall against the US dollar, broad-based sell-off across sectors, and concerns over weak corporate earnings and foreign fund outflows. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in Indian equities, worth ₹35,694.26 crore. Despite this, India's economy showed growth, with gross GST collections rising 9.1% year-on-year to ₹1.84 trillion in February 2025. The Index of Eight Core Industries increased 4.6% year-on-year in January 2025, with cement production growing the most at 14.5%. Globally, US equity markets decreased due to tariff concerns and interest rate uncertainty, while European markets rose on robust earnings. Asian markets were mixed, with Japan's market plunging due to mixed industrial production and retail sales data.
Here is a summary of the retail sales data for Jan'25 and the equity market outlook:

**Market Performance (M-o-M Basis)**: Not provided in the given data.

**Equity Market Outlook**:

* Global macro environment is complex, with possibilities of stagflation, consumer slowdown, and negative global growth impulse.
* Emerging markets, including India, may benefit from a potential US recession, leading to monetary policy easing and a depreciating US dollar.
* Europe and China's growth rates remain subdued, but Europe may benefit from the current environment, leading to policies that make it a better economic and geopolitical zone.
* Geopolitical tensions are increasing, making supply chains and global trade vulnerable.
* India remains a differentiated market with structural growth and earnings potential, despite a cyclical slowdown.
* Indian macro indicators are steady, with a current account deficit expected to be 1-1.5% for FY25E/FY26E.
* Earnings growth has moderated to mid-high single digits in FY25E, driven by reduced government spending, above-average monsoon, and stringent liquidity and administrative actions by RBI on retail credit.
* Financials, Pharma, industrials, Telecom, Hospital, Hotels, Aviation, and Real Estate are witnessing a healthy earnings cycle, while FMCG, Commodities, and IT face headwinds.
* The Indian equity market trades at an attractive valuation zone, with large caps seeming quite attractive.
* FY26/27 is expected to be a stock pickers market, with a focus on near-term earnings positives.
* The Indian economy is in a structural upcycle, driven by factors such as corporate and bank balance sheets, consumer spending, government focus on growth, and global supply chain re-alignments.
The FY23-27E period is expected to experience a healthy earnings cycle from a medium-term perspective, according to ICRA MFI Explorer.
Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the financial chart/graph as it appears in the image:

**Type of Chart:**

The image contains a combination of chart types:

*   **Bar Chart:** A series of vertical bars of varying heights are present.
*   **Line Chart:** A line connects data points, indicating a trend over time.

**Title and Data Displayed:**

The image is part of a "FACTSHEET" dated February 28, 2025. The chart likely represents the performance of a fund or investment portfolio. The bar chart probably represents the value of the fund over time, while the line chart could represent the fund's performance compared to a benchmark.

**Time Period:**

The time period covered by the chart is not explicitly labeled on the axes.

**Numerical Values and Trends:**

*   The bar chart shows a general upward trend, with some fluctuations. The bars vary in height, indicating changes in value over time.
*   The line chart also shows an upward trend, with data points connected by a dotted line.

**Comparison Benchmarks:**

It's possible that the line chart represents a comparison benchmark, but without a legend, it's difficult to confirm.
