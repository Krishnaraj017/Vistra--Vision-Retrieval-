India's economic indicators as of February 28, 2025: Consumer Price Index (CPI) at 4.31%, Wholesale Price Index (WPI) at 2.31%, Index of Industrial Production (IIP) at 3.2%, Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 56.3 for manufacturing and 59 for services, USD-INR exchange rate at 87.5125, and Brent crude oil price at $73.18.
Indian equity markets declined in February 2025, with Nifty 50 and S&P BSE Sensex falling 5.89% and 5.55% respectively, due to rupee's record fall against the US dollar, weak corporate earnings, and foreign fund outflows. In contrast, the US market also declined, with Dow Jones decreasing by 1.58%. The 10-Year benchmark paper yield in India remained range-bound at 6.729%, while the US 10-Year G-Sec yield closed lower at 4.2082%.
India's GDP grew 6.2% in Q3 FY25, driven by a 5.6% growth in Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry & Fishing, and a recovery in urban consumption, with a projected 6.5% real GDP growth for FY25.
Nifty 50 dropped 5.89% in Feb'25 due to rupee's record fall, weak corporate earnings, and foreign fund outflows. Foreign Institutional Investors were net sellers of Indian equities worth â‚¹35,694.26 crore. Despite this, GST collections rose 9.1% YoY and core industries grew 4.6% YoY in Jan 2025. Global markets were mixed, with US markets falling due to tariff concerns and European markets rising on robust earnings.
The global macro environment is complex, with potential for stagflation in the US, and uncertainty in global growth and capital flows. Emerging markets, including India, may benefit from a potential US recession and depreciation of the US dollar. India's macro environment remains strong, with a low current account deficit and steady domestic indicators. The domestic equity market is focused on earnings, with a healthy structural growth and earnings potential, although FY25E has moderated. The market trades at attractive valuations, with large caps being particularly attractive. The Indian economy is in a structural upcycle, driven by strong corporate and bank balance sheets, resilient consumer spending, government investments, and benefits from global supply chain re-alignments.
The table suggests a healthy earnings cycle for the medium term, from FY23 to FY27, according to ICRA MFI Explorer.
The image is a stylized graphic, likely a cover page or visual element for a research paper or report. The background is a gradient of dark to light blue. A person in a dark blue suit and white shirt is holding a pen or stylus, appearing to interact with a digital overlay.

The digital overlay consists of several graphical elements:
*   A series of translucent blue bar graphs of varying heights, resembling a stock market chart.
*   A line graph with white lines and orange dots, overlaid on the bar graphs.
*   Geometric shapes, including circles, hexagons, and arrows, connected by dotted lines, creating a futuristic or technological feel.
*   A circular, radar-like graphic with concentric circles and radiating lines, centered around the point where the pen is touching.
*   A globe-like structure made of interconnected dots in the lower right corner.

In the lower right corner, there is a white rounded rectangle containing the text "FACTSHEET" in large, bold, blue letters, and below it, "February 28, 2025" in smaller, blue letters.
The image contains the word "Index" in a large, sans-serif font. The color of the text is a light blue or cyan. A horizontal line underlines the word "Index." The background is white.
The image is a line graph comparing two economic indicators, CPI (Consumer Price Index) and WPI (Wholesale Price Index), over a period from February 2024 to January 2025. The y-axis represents the index value, ranging from 0.00 to 7.00, with increments of 1.00. The x-axis represents the months from February 2024 to January 2025.

The CPI is represented by a light blue line, starting at 5.09 in February 2024, fluctuating slightly until July 2024, then increasing to a peak around November 2024, and finally decreasing to 4.31 in January 2025.

The WPI is represented by an orange line, starting at 0.2 in February 2024, increasing sharply until June 2024, then decreasing until August 2024, increasing again until October 2024, and then remaining relatively stable until January 2025, where it ends at 2.31.

Horizontal dashed lines are present at each increment of 1.00 on the y-axis, providing a visual guide for the index values.
The image is a line graph depicting data points over a period of twelve months, from January 2024 to December 2024. The y-axis ranges from -10.00 to 8.00, with increments of 2.00. Horizontal dashed lines extend from each y-axis value across the graph. The x-axis is labeled with the months of the year, abbreviated to three letters, followed by '-24' to indicate the year 2024 (e.g., Jan-24, Feb-24, Mar-24, Apr-24, May-24, Jun-24, Jul-24, Aug-24, Sep-24, Oct-24, Nov-24, Dec-24). A light blue line connects the data points, showing a fluctuating trend over the year. The data point for January 2024 is labeled with the value "4.2," and the data point for December 2024 is labeled with the value "3.2."
The image is a line graph comparing the trends of "Manufacturing" and "Services" over time, from March 2024 to February 2025. The y-axis represents a numerical scale ranging from 53.00 to 62.00, with increments of 1.00. The x-axis represents the months, labeled as "Mar-24," "Apr-24," "May-24," "Jun-24," "Jul-24," "Aug-24," "Sep-24," "Oct-24," "Nov-24," "Dec-24," "Jan-25," and "Feb-25."

A light blue line represents "Manufacturing," starting at approximately 59.1 in March 2024 and ending at 56.3 in February 2025. An orange line represents "Services," starting at 61.2 in March 2024 and ending at 59.0 in February 2025. The graph also includes horizontal dashed lines at each increment of the y-axis to aid in visual comparison.
The image is a line graph showing the trends of two variables over time. The x-axis represents time, labeled with months from "Mar-24" to "Feb-25." The y-axis on the left side ranges from 80.00 to 88.00, while the y-axis on the right side ranges from 10.00 to 100.00.

There are two lines plotted on the graph. A light blue line represents "INR/USD," and an orange line represents "Brent crude (RHS) (USD/BL)." The "INR/USD" line starts at approximately 83.00 in March 2024 and generally decreases over time, ending at approximately 87.50 in February 2025. The "Brent crude (RHS) (USD/BL)" line starts at approximately 81.00 in March 2024, fluctuates, and ends at approximately 72.00 in February 2025. The graph has a grid of light gray dashed lines.

The left y-axis ranges from 7500 to 27500, with increments of 5000, and is presumably associated with the Nifty 50 index. The right y-axis, labeled "(RHS)," ranges from 18000 to 48000, with increments of 2000, and is associated with the Dow Jones index.

The Nifty 50 is represented by a blue line, while the Dow Jones is represented by an orange line. The legend at the bottom of the graph clearly identifies each index with its corresponding color. The graph shows the fluctuations of both indices over the specified period.
The image is a line graph comparing two sets of data over time. The x-axis represents time, labeled with months from "Feb-24" to "Feb-25." The y-axis on the left side ranges from 6.40 to 7.30, while the y-axis on the right side ranges from 0 to 5.

There are two lines plotted on the graph. A blue line represents "10 Yr Gsec," and an orange line represents "US 10 year Gsec (RHS) (%)". The blue line generally trends downward from around 7.10 in February 2024 to around 6.70 in February 2025. The orange line starts around 7.10 in February 2024, fluctuates, and ends around 7.20 in February 2025. The graph has horizontal gridlines to aid in reading the values.

The y-axis represents a numerical value, ranging from 0.00 to 12.00, with increments of 2.00. Horizontal dashed lines extend from each y-axis value across the graph. A blue line plots the data, starting at approximately 4.84 in "Dec-22," rising to a peak around 9.6 in "Jun-23," then fluctuating slightly before generally decreasing to around 5.6 in "Sep-24," and finally rising to 6.2 in "Dec-24." The values 4.84 and 6.2 are explicitly labeled on the graph at their respective data points.
